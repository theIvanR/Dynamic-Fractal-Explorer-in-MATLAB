Title: Dynamic Fractal Explorer in MATLAB

Description:
This MATLAB code implements a dynamic fractal explorer that allows users to visualize and interact with various fractal patterns. The explorer is equipped with features to zoom in and out, pan the plot, adjust resolution, switch between different rendering modes, and toggle Lyapunov mode for generating Lyapunov fractals. The code provides a versatile platform for exploring different fractal functions and their visual representations.

Features:

    Interactive exploration of fractal patterns.
    Zoom in/out and pan functionality for detailed exploration.
    Adjustable resolution for fine-tuning visual quality.
    Turbo mode for faster rendering of standard fractals.
    Lyapunov mode for generating Lyapunov fractals and calculating their exponents.

Usage:

    Set the initial window size and fractal function in the code.
    Run the script and observe the default fractal pattern.
    Interact with the plot using keyboard inputs:
        Arrow keys for panning.
        "+" and "-" keys for zooming.
        "q" and "e" keys to toggle resolution.
        "h" key to toggle HQ (high-quality) mode.
        "l" key to toggle Lyapunov mode.
        "z" and "x" keys to adjust iteration count.
    Watch as the fractal pattern dynamically updates based on user inputs.

This code provides an educational and visually appealing way to explore the fascinating world of fractals. Customize the fractal function and parameters to uncover new and mesmerizing patterns. Happy fractal exploration!
